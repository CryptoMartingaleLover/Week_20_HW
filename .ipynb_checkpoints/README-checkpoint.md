Week 20 Homework - Associate Profit Splitter Smart Contract
by Steve Stark

In this homework assignment, we were tasked with writing a Solidity smart contract in Remix, in order to allow an employer to pay 3 employees equally and simultaneously in ETH. The intention would be quick and efficient payment of workers. 

The smart contract code can be reviewed in the attached file "AssociateProfitSplitter_sol_code.txt". I have also included a .gif walkthrough of interaction with the smart contract. This walkthrough shows compilation of the contract, then selection of 3 recipient ETH addresses in Ganache, deployment of the contract, distribution of a deposit of 21 ETH split 3 ways (nice payday!) and a review of recipient account holdings to demonstrate that each employee account received their 7 ETH allotment.
